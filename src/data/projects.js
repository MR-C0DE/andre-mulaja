    description: "Developed a comprehensive hotel management platform using Node.js, Next.js, React, and Electron.",
    detail: "The school project involves developing a comprehensive hotel management solution with a robust architecture composed of two Node.js APIs connected to MongoDB and SQLite for efficient data management. The first API, dedicated to database management, handles CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and ensures data validation and consistency through an intelligent decision system that verifies and adjusts data before sending it. The second API, the central API, facilitates communication between the front-end applications and the database management API by exposing specific routes that allow the applications to access and manipulate data. The project includes several front-end applications: the central application, developed in NextJS, enables administrators to manage hotels, users, reservations, and services, offering features such as adding, deleting, modifying, and displaying detailed information about hotels and users, with an intuitive graphical interface for effective management. The hotel application, also developed in NextJS, is designed for hotel establishments and allows them to manage reservations, services, client communications, and room availability information, providing a practical interface for accepting or declining reservations, modifying hotel details, and managing offered services. The client application, developed in NextJS, allows clients to log in, make reservations, cancel reservations, communicate directly with hotels, rate hotels, and leave feedback on their experiences, offering a smooth and user-friendly interface. In addition to these front-end applications, the project also includes an internal management application developed in ElectronJS, specifically designed for internal hotel management, providing tools to manage users, services, and rooms, and enabling effective and centralized management of operations. The overall project aims to provide a complete and integrated solution for hotel management operations, using modern technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, SQLite, NextJS, and ElectronJS to ensure high performance, adaptability to various user needs, and scalability for future system requirements, all while being realized as part of a school project that applies advanced technical skills and a structured approach to software development.",

    description: "Created an efficient inventory management application with Nextjs, NodeJS, MySql.",
    detail: "In my personal project, I meticulously designed and implemented an efficient inventory management application utilizing Next.js for the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and MySQL for database management, while incorporating a comprehensive suite of security measures to safeguard the application and its data; this includes employing bcrypt for secure hashing of user passwords, ensuring that sensitive credentials are stored safely and cannot be easily compromised; integrating compression to reduce the size of HTTP responses and enhance overall performance by minimizing load times; configuring cors to manage and restrict cross-origin resource sharing, thereby preventing unauthorized domains from accessing the application’s resources; utilizing csurf to implement CSRF protection, thereby defending against malicious attempts to alter user data through forged requests; using dotenv to manage environment variables securely and keep sensitive information out of source control; implementing express-rate-limit to prevent brute-force attacks by limiting the number of requests a user can make within a specified time frame; leveraging express-validator to validate and sanitize user input, thereby preventing the processing of malicious data; incorporating helmet to set various HTTP headers that provide protection against well-known web vulnerabilities; employing jsonwebtoken for handling secure authentication and authorization through JSON Web Tokens, ensuring that user sessions are protected; integrating morgan for logging HTTP requests to aid in monitoring and debugging the application; using mysql2 as the MySQL client to facilitate efficient and secure interactions with the database; configuring nodemailer for secure email communications, such as sending notifications and password reset links; utilizing nodemon for automatic server restarts during development to streamline the workflow; leveraging winston for advanced logging capabilities to provide insights into system operations and assist with troubleshooting; and implementing xss to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing user inputs before rendering them on web pages; in addition to these security measures, I focused on creating a user-friendly and visually appealing graphical interface, ensuring that the application provides an intuitive and seamless user experience with a modern and responsive design, making it accessible and easy to navigate across various devices and screen sizes, thus delivering not only robust functionality and security but also an engaging and efficient interface for managing inventory.",
